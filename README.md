</p>

# Introduction
This project is developed as part of our AI class in our second year of college. Our goal is to build an intelligent system that classifies waste into different categories using image recognition. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this system will help in efficient waste management by categorizing waste into biodegradable, recyclable, and hazardous types.

## Features:
‚úÖ Image-based waste classification
‚úÖ Deep learning for accurate predictions
‚úÖ Environmentally impactful AI solution
